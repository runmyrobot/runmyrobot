<h1> Open Robot Control Code For Connecting to LetsRobot.tv </h1>

LetsRobot.tv is a site for interacts with other using telepresence robots. User create their own robots and add them to the site.
https://letsrobot.tv


<h2> Quick Install </h2>


Copy this into the terminal, and follow the instructions.
This script has been tested on a Raspberry Pi 3, with a fresh flash of "2017-04-10-raspbian-jessie-lite".

```
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runmyrobot/runmyrobot/master/scripts/install.sh -O /tmp/install.sh && bash /tmp/install.sh
```

After end installtion, all the files needed should be installed and ready for use, but you still might need to change some arguments in your "/home/pi/start_robot" file, to make it suit your robot.

To edit your start_robot file, put this into the terminal.

```sudo nano /home/pi/start_robot```

<h2> Manual Install </h2>

<h3> Installing robot control and video scripts </h3>


The RasPi will need the following things install so it can talk to your motor and talk to the internet.

(1) Install [motor HAT software](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-dc-and-stepper-motor-hat-for-raspberry-pi/installing-software):


(2) Install python serial, gnutls, python-dev, espeak, and python-smbus:

```apt-get install python-serial python-dev libgnutls28-dev espeak python-smbus python-pip git```


(3) Install socket.io client for python:

```pip install socketIO-client```


(4) Install alsa-lib
```
cd /usr/local/src 
wget ftp://ftp.alsa-project.org/pub/lib/alsa-lib-1.0.25.tar.bz2 
tar xjf alsa-lib-1.0.25.tar.bz2
cd /usr/local/src/alsa-lib-1.0.25 
./configure --host=arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi 
make -j4 
sudo make install
```

(5) Install x264
```
cd /usr/local/src
git clone git://git.videolan.org/x264
cd x264
./configure --host=arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi --enable-static --disable-opencl
make -j4
sudo make install
```

(6) Install FFmpeg
```
cd /usr/local/src
git clone https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg.git
cd FFmpeg
./configure --arch=armel --target-os=linux --enable-gpl --enable-libx264 --enable-nonfree --enable-gnutls --extra-libs=-ldl
make -j4
sudo make install
```



<h2> Bring your Bot to life: Programs to run on the Raspberry Pi </h2>

Start by cloning the runmyrobot repository
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/runmyrobot/runmyrobot
cd runmyrobot
```

Go to new robot page to create a robot. If you already have one, got to manage robots. There you'll find your Robot ID and Camera ID.

These two scripts need to be running in the background to bring your robot to life: controller.py, send_video.py. Here are instructions about how to start them.

Copy the 'start_robot' Script from runmyrobot/Scripts to the pi home folder

```cp ~/runmyrobot/scripts/start_robot ~/```

Edit the script so you can adjust some settings for controller.py and send_video.py:

```nano ~/start_robot```

Edit the YOURROBOTID to your robot ID.

Edit the YOURCAMERAID to your camera ID.

You are getting both IDs when you are creating a new bot on the website.

The second parameter on send_video.py 0 is assuming you have one camera plugged into your Pi and you are using it, which is usually the case.

There are more parameter possible for controller.py:

```robot_id```

Your Robot ID. Required

```--env prod | dev```

Environment for example dev or prod | default='prod'

```--type motor_hat | serial | l298n | motozero```

What type of motor controller should be used | default='motor_hat'

```--serial-device /dev/ttyACM0```

Serial device | default='/dev/ttyACM0'

```--male```

Use TTS with a male voice

```--female```

Use TTS with a female voice

```--voice-number 1```

What voice should be used | default=1

```--led max7219```

What LEDs should be used (if any) | default=none

```--ledrotate 180```

Rotates the LED matrix | default=none

Example start_robot:

```
cd /home/pi/runmyrobot
nohup scripts/repeat_start python controller.py YOURROBOTID --type motor_hat --male --voice-number 1 --led max7219 --ledrotate 180 &> /dev/null &
nohup scripts/repeat_start python send_video.py YOURCAMERAID 0 &> /dev/null &
```

<h3> Start script on boot </h3>
Use crontab to start the start_robot script on booting:

```
crontab -e
```

insert following line and save:

```
@reboot /bin/bash /home/pi/start_robot
```

That's it!

<h2> How does this work </h2>

We use ffmpeg to stream audio and socket.io to send control messages.

<h2> How to contribute </h2>

The is a community project. Making your own bot? Adding your own control stuff? Cool! We'd like to hear from you.


<h1> Hardware Compatibility </h1>

Missing something?, you can add it, open source!


<h1> Instructions for Specific Hardward Configurations </h1>

<h2> GoPiGo3 </h2>

For GoPiGo3, you will need to install the gopigo3 python module (which is different than older versions). It will need to be installed with the installation script from Dexter. Also, PYTHONPATH needs to be set to "/home/pi/Dexter/GoPiGo3/Software/Python"

Refer to this:
https://github.com/DexterInd/GoPiGo3
```
sudo git clone http://www.github.com/DexterInd/GoPiGo3.git /home/pi/Dexter/GoPiGo3
sudo bash /home/pi/Dexter/GoPiGo3/Install/install.sh
sudo reboot
```
